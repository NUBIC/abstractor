The categories of the ICD-O usually contain several tumour entities. The label of a category is a single tumour entity, too.
Synonyms are listed for some entities and in some cases Abbreviations are mentioned, too. 
For individual synonyms there can be mention of relevant abbreviations.

In order to preserve the highest degree of detail for future tabulations and for transitions a second and a third column are created.  
The single tumour entities have been assigned an individual code (Term). 
In addition every entry has his own code (String unique identifier=SUI).

The entries (Bez) are marked whether they are a label of a category(c), a synonym(J),  a preferred term for a tumour entity (N) or just a different spelling (S).
There is a column for the attribute "obsolete term" (OBS) or "current term"(NOTOBS).
The next column contains the "usual site" (see coding guidelines of the ICD-O-3).
Finally there are cross-references, exclusion statements and notes.

code	term  	SUI 	type	usage	title				site   crossref.  excl.  note

8090/3	  77 	138	c	NOTOBS	basal cell carcinoma NOS	C44.-|	
8090/3	  77  	139 	J	NOTOBS	basal cell epithelioma		C44.-|	
8090/3	  77  	140 	J	NOTOBS	Ulcus rodens		C44.-|	
8090/3	  78  	141  	N	NOTOBS	pigmented basal cell carcinoma 	

for the topography only level of the code, SUI and type are applicable.
